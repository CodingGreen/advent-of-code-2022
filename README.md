# Advent of Code 2022

Here is my source code for Advent of Code 2022. I said [last year](https://github.com/CodingGreen/advent-of-code-2021) that I was tempted to use [RamdaJS](https://ramdajs.com/) this time around so that is what I'm going to be doing! This repository was generated from my [advent-of-code-runner template](https://github.com/CodingGreen/advent-of-code-runner) so I could get going straight away.
